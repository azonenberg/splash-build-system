# Recursive global configuration (one YAML document per toolchain, containing a single object named "recursive_config")
# Syntax is identical to that of a normal target, except only configuration is legal (no sources block)
# Configuration specified here applies to targets in the current file, as well as in all subdirectories.
# This block is normally only used in the build.yml file at the root of the project, but it's legal to use
# at lower scopes (for example, configuration of a major subsystem with its own directory)

# This is a fairly sane default configuration for cpp/generic
