# An actual target (many targets allowed in only one document)
# Most build.yml files in individual source directories will only contain targets and not configurations.

MultiArch:

    # type of compiler to use (generic C++ compiler, no preference on version or suite)
    toolchain:     cpp/generic
    
    # Target type (default for cpp: exe)
    
    # array of architectures we're being compiled for
    # The special target "global" pulls in the globally specified targets.
    # Having no "targets" section at all is equivalent to "targets: [global]" and is usually a sane default.
    # In this case, however, we're adding additional targets to the global list
    arches:
        - global
        - i386-linux-gnu
        
    # array of source files (TODO support wildcards)
    sources:
        - main.cpp

    # Toolchain flags
    # No special config here, inherit global configs
    # Note that global only NEEDS to be specified if we're adding flags.
    # If you want to use global flags exclusively, just omit the entire flags section
    flags:
        - global
